# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Dataverse Debugger is a community project. The maintainers aim to keep the latest `main` branch and the most recent tagged release secure. Older releases may not receive patches, so please upgrade to the latest version before filing a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not create a public issue for security concerns.**
2. Use GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature for this repository, or open a [GitHub Security Advisory Draft](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories) that only maintainers can see.
3. Provide as much detail as possible: affected versions, reproduction steps, potential impact, and suggested mitigations.
4. The maintainers will acknowledge the report within 5 business days, keep you informed about the validation process, and coordinate a disclosure timeline if needed.

If you cannot use GitHub's reporting flow, create a new issue marked "Security" and include contact details so a maintainer can follow up privately.

## Disclosure Process

- Valid reports will be triaged and fixed privately.
- Once a fix is ready, a release will be cut, and the advisory will be published with acknowledgements (if desired).
- Credit will be given unless you request anonymity.

Thank you for helping keep the Dataverse Debugger community safe.
